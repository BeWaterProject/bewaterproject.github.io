      <h1>2022 Impact Report</h1>

      <p>This page will be all about the impact that Be Water has had, and include links to the projects.</p>

      <p>The COVID-19 pandemic no-doubt slowed down our work on the ground. Behind the scenes we've been busy working with our project partners to make sure we have as big an impact as possible in 2022.</p>

      <p>To date, we've raised €x,xxx and spent €y,yyy, leaving €z,zzz to deploy.</p>

      <p>Every single Euro we've spent has gone directly to projects.</p>

      <p>Our work has brought access to clean water to 2,430 people, in 3 different countries in Africa.</p>

      <p>In 2022 we'll be putting €x,xyz to work in Senegal, our fourth country, and we hope to bring clean water to XYZ people.</p>
