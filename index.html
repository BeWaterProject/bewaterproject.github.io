        <h2>Why do we exist?</h2>
        <p>Each year, more than 3.5 million children die from water-related illnesses. Diarrhea alone kills 1.8 million children each year, which is around the population of Barcelona!</p>
        <p>Our vision is to facilitate access to clean water for as many people as possible in rural Africa. We work with a local NGO on each project, to ensure continuity and the long-term impact of our work.</p>
